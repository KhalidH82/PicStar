<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This application is a photo collection where users can upload pictures and add a location and description of the photo. Users are able to view all photos uploaded by other users and add comments if they choose. They will also have a personal collection to view as well.</p>

<h2>Future Build Out</h2>
<p>Some other things that I would like my app to include is the ability for users to have friends where they are only able to see each others photos and not all users. Also I would like the comments to be edited and deleted as well. Another feature I want to incorporate is a search bar which take the location take of the photo and place markers on a Google map utilizing their API services.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>Ruby on Rails, Devise, Paperclip, Bootstrap</p>

<h2>Database structure</h2>
<p>My database consists of 3 tables, users photos and comments.</p>
