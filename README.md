PicStar
Mini Ruby on Rails Project

Name and Description
PicStar
This application is a photo collection where users can upload pictures and add a location and description of the photo. Users are able to view all photos uploaded by other users and add comments if they choose.

Future Build Out
Some other things that I would like my app to include is the ability for users to have friends where they are only able to see each others photos and not all users. Also I would like the comments to be edited and deleted as well. Another feature I want to incorporate is a search bar which take the location take of the photo and place markers on a Google map.

Technologies Used
Ruby on Rails, Devise, Paperclip, Bootstrap

Database structure
My database consists of 3 tables, users photos and comments.
